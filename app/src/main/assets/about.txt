This game works by simply guessing the letters that make up a country using the length of country name as hint.

To enter a letter, a keyboard has been specially designed for you which changes color based on your input.

For a valid letter, the background color changes to green, while for a wrong input/guess
It changes to red.
A key can't be entered more than once.

Example, - - - - - has 5 dashes
It could be one of Spain, Japan, China, Ghana or any other country made of 5 letters.
Assuming the generated word is Ghana

You can enter "a" on the keyboard, it changes to - - a - a
It replaces all occurrences of the valid letter.

A valid input grants at least 2 point => 2 points per letter, "a" in "Ghana" entered once would allocate you 4 points

Once complete (all dashes replaced), it generates a new word and the cycle goes on.
A word can't be generated more than once in a single run.

Entering an invalid letter, like "p" in this case would make no change to the dashed text.
You are allowed to make 5 wrong guesses for each generated word.
After that, the game ends, displays the generated word, and your score.
